Please upload an image named "Impossible_staircase.svg.png" to your repository.

The image should be a clear representation of a Penrose staircase (impossible staircase).
You can find suitable images by searching for "Penrose stairs" or "Impossible staircase" online.

For best results, use an image with:
- A clear view of all 14 steps
- Good contrast
- Minimal background
- Preferably top-down isometric view similar to the diagram in your earlier message

The implementation is designed to overlay orange highlights on each step as the user scrolls.
