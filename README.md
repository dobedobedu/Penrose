## 3D Penrose Staircase Implementation

This repository contains a CSS/JS implementation of the famous Penrose staircase (impossible staircase) with scroll-based animation.

### Features:
- 3D staircase built entirely with CSS transforms
- Lighting up steps as the user scrolls down the page
- Perspective toggle to view the staircase from different angles
- Keyboard, touch, and scroll navigation

### Files:
- **penrose-3d.html**: HTML structure for the 3D staircase
- **penrose-3d.css**: CSS styling and 3D transforms
- **penrose-3d.js**: JavaScript for scroll interaction and step highlighting

### How to Use:
1. Open the `penrose-3d.html` file in your browser
2. Scroll down to see each step light up in sequence
3. Click the "Toggle Perspective" button to view the staircase from a different angle
4. Use arrow keys to navigate between steps
