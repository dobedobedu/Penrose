🧠 Thought Experiments (5)

# Veil of Ignorance
Imagine designing a society without knowing your own future status, talents, or class. Rawls argues that rational self-interest behind the veil yields fair rules for all. It’s a lens for equitable AI policy and product-access decisions.

# Maxwell’s Demon
A tiny demon sorts fast and slow molecules, seemingly violating the second law of thermodynamics. The paradox probes the cost of information and the link between entropy and computation. It highlights why “free” data processing really isn’t free.

# Chinese Room
A person who understands no Chinese follows a rulebook to produce perfect Chinese replies, fooling outsiders. Does the room “understand” Chinese or merely simulate it? This challenges strong AI claims about consciousness and meaning.

# Fermi Paradox
The galaxy is vast and old, yet we see no evidence of extraterrestrial civilizations. Solutions span from self-destruction to simulation hypotheses, urging reflection on sustainability and observation bias.

# Infinite Monkey Theorem
An immortal monkey hitting random keys will eventually type Shakespeare’s works. It quantifies the power—and limits—of randomness, reinforcing why structured creativity and probability literacy matter in data science.
